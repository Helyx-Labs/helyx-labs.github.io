      <h1>Building Systems that <span>Actually Matter</span></h1>
      <p>
        Helyx Labs exists to show what AI can actually do when it’s applied properly.
        Not robots. Not science fiction. Just language models, automation, and systems that make digital work faster, simpler, and more human.
      </p>

<!-- CORE MISSION -->
<section>
  <div class="mission-block">
    <h2>The Idea Behind it All</h2>
    <p>
        The real power of AI isn’t in replacing people — it’s in removing friction.
        Writing, searching, organising, deciding, building — most digital work is slowed down by tools that don’t adapt to the user.
        <br><br>
        Helyx Labs focuses on using modern AI models and automation to accelerate workflows people already have.
        Tools that fit into how you work, instead of forcing you to change how you think.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="mission-block">
    <h2>Why Helyx Labs Exists</h2>
    <p>
        Digitisation happened fast. Good digitisation didn’t.
        <br><br>
        A lot of systems today are digital versions of old processes — layered, inefficient, and disconnected.
        AI gives us a chance to rethink that.
        Not by adding more features, but by letting software understand context, intent, and language the way humans naturally use it.
        <br><br>
        Helyx Labs is dedicated to building those systems — tools that don’t just digitise work, but actually make it better.

      <span>PAST</span>
      <h3>Helyx Labs App</h3>
      <p>
        The Helyx Labs app was built to explore how AI could sit inside everyday workflows.
        It wasn’t about novelty — it was about learning where AI genuinely helps and where it gets in the way.
        <br><br>
        The app is deprecated now, but the ideas behind it continue to shape everything we’re building.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="vision-card">
      <span>PRESENT</span>
      <h3>Spectra Browser</h3>
      <p>
        Spectra is an experiment in applying AI at the foundation level — the browser.
        It explores how AI can assist with navigation, research, organisation, and focus without becoming intrusive.
        <br><br>
        The goal isn’t to make the browser smarter.
        It’s to make the user faster.
      </p>

  <!-- FOUNDER NOTE -->
  <div class="founder-note">
    <h2>A Note from the Founder</h2>
    <p>
        I started Helyx Labs because I was tired of building things that didn’t feel meaningful.
        I wanted to create systems I could actually trust — software that respects time, thought, and engineering discipline, instead of fighting against them.
        <br><br>
        Helyx Labs began as experimentation, but it didn’t stay personal for long.
        The moment it became clear that AI could genuinely reduce effort and complexity — not in theory, but in practice — the scope changed. What started as exploration became responsibility.
        <br><br>
        This lab exists to show what’s possible right now with today’s models when they’re applied thoughtfully.
        No exaggeration. No over-engineering. Just careful use of tools that already exist, aimed at making real workflows faster, simpler, and less fragile.
        <br><br>
        Helyx Labs isn’t a startup chasing scale for its own sake. It’s a lab in the true sense — a place to test ideas, discard what doesn’t work, and keep refining what does. Some projects will evolve. Some will end. That’s part of building honestly.
        <br><br>
        That’s the direction everything here is moving toward.
