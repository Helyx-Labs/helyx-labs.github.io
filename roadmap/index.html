      <h3>Where it Really Began</h3>
      <p>
        My journey into building things started back in 2023, when I was in 6th grade.
        <br><br>
        That was the first time I was introduced to HTML at school. A lot of the credit for making it interesting goes to Saket Sir, who taught it in a very engaging and enjoyable way. The classes never felt dry or overly technical — they felt creative, which made a big difference.
        <br><br>
        For the first time, I wasn’t just using technology. I was starting to understand how things on the web were actually made.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h3>Exploring More</h3>
      <p>
        Even though the school lessons were enjoyable, I remember feeling like I had only seen a small part of something much bigger.
        <br><br>
        That curiosity pushed me to start learning HTML on my own. I spent time experimenting, trying things out, and slowly understanding how pages were structured.
        <br><br>
        One major advantage I had during this phase was the environment at home. Both my parents are software developers, so I had constant support, guidance, and answers whenever I got stuck or confused.
        <br><br>
        That support played a huge role in keeping the learning process smooth and encouraging.

      <h3>Learning by Building</h3>
      <p>
        Over the next couple of years, I kept building small projects and websites.
        <br><br>
        Most of them were never published — they were purely for learning and experimentation. But those projects helped me develop a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        <br><br>
        More importantly, they helped me become comfortable with the process of creating something from scratch, breaking it, fixing it, and improving it.
        <br><br>
        This was a very quiet phase — no public releases, no products — just learning and practice.
      </p>

      <h3>Discovering Python</h3>
      <p>
        By March 2025, I wanted to build things that went beyond the frontend.
        <br><br>
        While I was comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I felt the need to work with something more logic-driven — programs that didn’t just display information but actually performed tasks and calculations.
        <br><br>
        On my father’s advice, I started learning Python.
        <br><br>
        I learnt entirely through YouTube, without any formal classes, spending the month exploring the language through practice and experimentation. Python immediately clicked with me and introduced me to a new way of thinking about programming.
        <br><br>
        It sparked my interest in mathematical computations, logic-based problem solving, and early AI and machine learning concepts
        <br><br>
        By the end of the month, Python had become a tool I was genuinely comfortable with, marking a clear shift in my journey from frontend development to more general-purpose programming.

      <h3>The Idea of Whispr</h3>
      <p>
        In April 2025, I started questioning how inefficient normal computer workflows felt. Even simple tasks required multiple steps, constant window switching, and endless distractions.
        <br><br>
        That thought led to the idea of <b>Whispr</b>, powered by <b>WhisprAI</b> — a minimal bar that would stay on the screen, listen to voice input, understand instructions, and respond conversationally.
        <br><br>
        The goal was simple: express intent instead of navigating software.
        <br><br>
        At this stage, Whispr existed only as a concept, but it marked the beginning of a much bigger direction.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h3>First Working Prototype</h3>
      <p>
        During the summer break in May 2025, I began building Whispr and developed an early prototype that could record audio on a button click, transcribe it using an open-source model by OpenAI, and open the app or website I instructed it to.
        <br><br>
        For the first time, Whispr moved from concept to something that actually worked.

      <h3>Whispr Goes Public</h3>
      <p>
        In August 2025, our school disabled Google Chat for student accounts, a decision made for safety reasons. Since it had been our primary communication channel, this change created an immediate gap.
        <br><br>
        In response, I built WhisprLink, which became my first publicly accessible project. It worked, gained real usage, and still exists at its original domain, with access still limited to my classmates.
        <br><br>
        More importantly, this experience taught me the responsibility that comes with building things for real users. It also changed my mindset — Whispr didn’t have to remain a private experiment; it could be built openly.

      <h3>Building Under Pressure</h3>
      <p>
        By September 2025, I had realised that the original “bar at the bottom” idea for Whispr wasn’t very practical. Around the same time, with the CBSE Skill Expo approaching, I decided to quickly build a proper application instead.
        <br><br>
        That’s when the Helyx Labs App was created — named quite literally because there wasn’t time to overthink branding. I developed the early alpha versions and eventually a working prototype capable of opening apps and websites through voice commands, now in a more stable and structured form.
        <br><br>
        Shortly after, I learned that the project hadn’t been selected at the school level for the expo. Even so, I continued building and improving the app.

      <h3>Expanding Helyx Core</h3>
      <p>
        By November 2025, the Helyx Labs App had evolved significantly. I had integrated Helyx Ignite, Helyx Aud, and Helyx Cogni, along with a proper login and logout system.
        <br><br>
        These additions allowed the app to handle voice interactions, generate mood-based playlists through Spotify, and use Google’s then-flagship AI models, Gemini 2.5 Flash & Pro for AI-driven features.
        <br><br>
        This phase also marked the formation of my first real user base, with around 10 active logged-in users using the app.
        <br><br>
        Around this time, I also began exploring machine learning through Hugging Face, which gave me early exposure to ML concepts and a practical understanding of how servers and hosted systems work.

      <h3>The Birth of Spectra</h3>
      <p>
        By December 2025, I had begun questioning the practicality of building a standalone app. Most users simply don’t install niche applications, no matter how capable they are.
        <br><br>
        That thought led to a new idea: instead of another app, why not build a browser — something people already use constantly? The vision was a productivity-oriented browser that could combine AI, music, focus, and user-centric features in a single environment.
        <br><br>
        This is when Spectra was conceived. The Helyx Labs App became a proof-of-concept project, and I began developing Spectra, carrying forward its core ideas while introducing an entirely new direction.

      <h3>Spectra Becomes Real</h3>
      <p>
        By February 2026, Spectra had reached the 1.x.x stage and had grown into something far more stable and refined. It wasn’t just functional — it performed reliably and smoothly.
        <br><br>
        The browser now featured polished visuals, improved graphics, and more advanced data handling, making it feel like a complete product rather than an experiment.
        <br><br>
        Around the same time, I upgraded the website to use a CMS-based system, allowing content to be updated dynamically without modifying the code — a practical improvement that significantly reduced maintenance effort.

      <h3>Intelligence and AI era</h3>
      <p>
        The Spectra 3.x series represents a conceptual shift from a traditional browser to an intelligence-driven environment. In this phase, AI is planned to become a native part of the browsing experience rather than an added feature.
        <br><br>
        Spectra 3.0.0 is designed as the primary milestone, introducing deeper AI integration, contextual assistance, and workflows where the browser can actively help interpret and process information.
        <br><br>
        3.1.0 focuses on enhanced AI features and smarter interactions, while 3.2.0 explores context-aware behavior and session understanding.

        3.3.0 is intended to strengthen the productivity layer, enabling users to analyze, transform, and work with content more efficiently.
        <br><br>
        Overall, the 3.x cycle centers on intelligence, adaptability, and redefining how users interact with the web.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <div class="date">Upcoming</div>
      <h3>Identity and Multi-Profile era</h3>
      <p>
        The 4.x series will focus on making Spectra truly user-centric. The goal is to support multiple identities, giving each user their own profile, history, and settings while keeping everything secure and personalized.
        <br><br>
        Spectra 4.0.0 will introduce a multi-profile architecture, enabling profile switching, session isolation, and profile-specific histories and configurations.
        <br><br>
        Later updates are planned to expand profile personalization with avatars, preferences, and possibly themes (4.1.0), strengthen security and data protection (4.2.0), and add cloud backup and sync functionality for seamless continuity across devices (4.3.0).
        <br><br>
        Overall, the 4.x cycle emphasizes ownership, identity, and continuity, ensuring Spectra adapts to each user individually.
